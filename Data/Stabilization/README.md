# Stabilization Data Overview

This folder contains all of the appliance stabilization data we collected. This
data was used to determine the limitations of what we can model in the house
in regards to temperature and humidity. In addition this data was used to determine
the timing to use to reach target scaled temperatures in the simulations.

We ran each appliance individually until it reached its maximum or minimum temperature
or humidity. We then turned off the appliance and continued to record sensor
readings until they returned to the starting temperature and humidity.
