## Background
The purpose of this research project is to develop a flexible IoT augmented physical
scale model of a suburban home that can be used to perform accelerated experiments
in various simulated environments. The data collected with this model will be used
to create a program that implements smart-home behavior inside the model house to
automatically react to changes in the environment. Our ultimate goal is to develop
a smart-home program that regulates temperature in an energy efficient and cost effective manner.

## Overview
We had many different goals for this project. The main goal was to expand upon
the previous state of the house and make data collection and experimentation with
the house easier and more widely applicable to locations with different climates.
In addition to this, we wanted to find a machine learning algorithm that was able
very accurately predict the internal temperatures of the house. This would allow
future students who expand on this project to focus on developing an intelligent
agent that is able to regulate the temperature and humidity of the house in an
energy efficient manner.

## Navigation
The work we have done over the course of this internship is split up into the following
three folders.

The [Code](https://github.com/nia-00/UCF_REU_SmartHome_2021/tree/main/Code)
folder contains all of the code we wrote to control the house, collect
data from the sensors, prepare the data for analysis, and analyze the data with
different machine learning algorithms.

The [Data](https://github.com/nia-00/UCF_REU_SmartHome_2021/tree/main/Data)
folder contains all of the data we collected in each stage of the data
preparation process. It also contains the weather data we modeled our simulations
after, appliance stabilization data we used to determine the timing of our
simulations, and graphs of the performances of the machine learning algorithms.

The [Simulation Files](https://github.com/nia-00/UCF_REU_SmartHome_2021/tree/main/Simulation%20Files)
folder contains all of our simulations as well as a detailed
description of each type of simulation and the keys and commands used within them.
