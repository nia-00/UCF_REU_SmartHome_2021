## Background
The purpose of this research project is to develop a flexible IoT augmented physical
scale model of a suburban home that can be used to perform accelerated experiments
in various simulated environments. The data collected with this model will be used
to create a program that implements smart-home behavior inside the model house to
automatically react to changes in the environment. Our ultimate goal is to develop
a smart-home program that regulates termperature in an energy efficient manner and is cost effective.
