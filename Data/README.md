# Data Overview

The folders above contain different kinds of data we used for this project.

The [Simulation_Data](https://github.com/nia-00/UCF_REU_SmartHome_2021/tree/main/Data/Simulation_Data) folder contains all the data we have collected from the house when
running simulations. There is a subfolder for the separate sensor and actuator readings
and a subfolder for the cleaned combine data files we will use for our machine
learning algorithms.

The [Stabilization](https://github.com/nia-00/UCF_REU_SmartHome_2021/tree/main/Data/Stabilization) folder contains the stabilization data collected for each of our
appliances. This data is used to find the temperature and humidity limitations of
our greenhouse ScaledHome environment. We use these limitations to map our real-world
weather data to temperatures and humidities we can reach in the ScaledHome.

The [Weather](https://github.com/nia-00/UCF_REU_SmartHome_2021/tree/main/Data/Weather)
folder contains the real world data for each of our chosen cities. Further descriptions
of the data and how we used it can be found in this folder as well.
