# Stabilization Data Overview

This folder contains all of the appliance stabilization data we collected. This
data was used to determine the limitations of what we can model in the house
in regards to temperature and humidity. In addition this data was used to determine
the timing to use to reach target scaled temperatures in the simulations.
