The purpose of this research project is to perform accelerated experiments in various simulated environments on our scaled home. Our ultimate goal is to develop a smart-home
program that predicts and regulates temperature in an energy-efficient and cost-effective manner. With this in mind, it is essential to be able to simulate a variety of real 
environments in our SmartHome home and enclosure in order to make our data useful for nationwide, or worldwide, application.  Therefore, we chose 5 cities during a partcular month
that represents the diverse climate of the United States (only taking into account temperature and humidity):

Charlotte, NC - Moderate, Moderate - April - April 21, 2020
Denver, CO - Cool, Dry - December - December 4, 2020
Detroit, MI - Cool, Humid - March - March 3, 2020
Jacksonville, FL - Hot, Humid - July - July 26, 2020
Las Vegas, NV - Hot, Dry - June - June 1, 2020

UCF_REU_SmartHome_2021/Data/Weather/Original_Files/ : Contains weather data for our chosen cities and months. Includes Max Temp, Avg Temp, Min Temp, Humidity (%), Max Humidity
(%), and Avg Humidity (%) Min. Includes monthly averages for the above listed categories. The "Average Difference" section of these spreadsheets calculates the average difference
between each day's weather information and the monthly average weather data. The day with the lowest avergage difference is the particular day we use to model our simulations 
after. Further down, the hourly weather data for the chosen date is listed.

UCF_REU_SmartHome_2021/Data/Weather/Monthly/CSV/ : Contains daily weather data of the cities for the selected month (see lines 8-12).

UCF_REU_SmartHome_2021/Data/Weather/Daily/ : Contains hourly temperature and humidity data of the cities for the selected day (see lines 8-12). Also contains a folder of this data
represented in multi-line graphs.
